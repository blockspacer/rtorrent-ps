To get in contact and share your experiences with other users of `PyroScope`_,
join the `rtorrent-community`_ channel `rtorrent-ps`_ on Gitter.

This is also the way to resolve any problems with or questions about your configuration
and software installation.
*Always* look into the :ref:`trouble-shooting` as a first measure,
which is often the fastest way to get back to a working system.
That guide also explains how to efficiently report your problem when you cannot fix it yourself.
